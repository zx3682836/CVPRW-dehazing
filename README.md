# CVPRW2021-dehazing

Code and dehazing results of my paper "Single Image Dehazing Using Bounded Channel Difference Prior". 
The algorithm is further optimized on SOTS dataset, and some results may be different from those in the paper.
Run 'main.m' for single image dehazing examples.
Run 'evaluate_new.m' for evaluation on SOTS dataset.
